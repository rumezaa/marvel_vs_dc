create 3d character array (7 marvel characters, 7 DC characters)

main METHOD

    set game to true
    set play to true

    WHILE play is true
        create a parallel array for lives that makes random floats from 15-40 for each characater
        call on call_players method


        get a random opponent
        call on get_attacks method to get attacks for opponent and player
        call on get_life method to get lives for opponent and player

        WHILE gameplay is true
            check if the user or opponent life is less than 0
                IF less than 0 print out winner (character w/ life grater than 0)
                    ask user if they want to play again
                    IF user wants to play again break current loop
                    IF not then end outer and inner loop


call_players METHOD:

    enter first dim of charac array
        enter second dim of charac array
            get the player and attacks from the iterating array
            use position of the array in second dim to get the lives from parallel array (lives)

            print out the player name, attacks and life


get_attacks METHOD takes params playerName

    enter the first dim of charac array
        enter second dim of charac array
            if playerName matches the player in the iterating array return the attacks from the current array

get_life METHOD
HOD takes params playerName

    enter first dim of charac array
        enter second dim of charac array
            use position(index) of the current iterating array to get the corresponding life from lives array

            return the life


battle METHOD
    set a random attack hit between 1 and 5 for opponent and player

    ask the user to enter a num 1-3 to choose a character attack

    subtract hit from the user/opponent life and print out the attack that was used
